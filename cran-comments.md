* This release (0.3.1) is just a patch:

* Updated data and examples to set the levels of responses with "yes", "no", and
  "maybe" categories so they show in that order. Same for the icecream data to
  sort by "vanilla", "chocolate", and "strawberry", and seasons to be "fall", 
  "winter", "spring", and "summer".
