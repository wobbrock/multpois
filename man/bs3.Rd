\title{Between-subjects 2Ã—2 design with polytomous response}
\format{
A data frame with 60 observations on the following 4 variables:
\describe{
\item{PId}{a subject identifier with levels \code{"1"} ... \code{"60"}}
\item{X1}{a between-subjects factor with levels \code{"a"}, \code{"b"}}
\item{X2}{a between-subjects factor with levels \code{"c"}, \code{"d"}}
\item{Y}{a polytomous response with categories \code{"yes"}, \code{"no"}, and \code{"maybe"}}
}
}
\description{
This generic synthetic dataset has a polytomous response \code{Y} and two factors
\code{X1} and \code{X2}. The response has categories \code{\{yes,no,maybe\}}.
Factor \code{X1} has levels \code{\{a,b\}}, and factor \code{X2} has levels
\code{\{c,d\}}. It also has a \code{PId} column for participant identifier.
Each participant is on only one row.

bs3$X2 = factor(bs3$X2)
