\title{Between-subjects 2Ã—2 design with dichotomous response}
\format{
A data frame with 60 observations on the following 4 variables:
\describe{
\item{PId}{a subject identifier with levels \code{"1"} ... \code{"40"}}
\item{X1}{a between-subjects factor with levels \code{"a"}, \code{"b"}}
\item{X2}{a between-subjects factor with levels \code{"c"}, \code{"d"}}
\item{Y}{a dichotomous response with categories \code{"yes"}, \code{"no"}}
}
}
\description{
This generic synthetic dataset has a dichotomous response \code{Y} and two factors
\code{X1} and \code{X2}. The response has categories \code{\{yes,no\}}.
Factor \code{X1} has levels \code{\{a,b\}}, and factor \code{X2} has levels
\code{\{c,d\}}. It also has a \code{PId} column for participant identifier.
Each participant is on only one row.

\examples{
data(bs2, package="multpois")

bs2$PId = factor(bs2$PId)
bs2$Y = factor(bs2$Y, levels=c("yes","no"))
bs2$X1 = factor(bs2$X1)
bs2$X2 = factor(bs2$X2)
contrasts(bs2$X1) <- "contr.sum"
contrasts(bs2$X2) <- "contr.sum"

m = glm.mp(Y ~ X1*X2, data=bs2)
Anova.mp(m, type=3)
glm.mp.con(m, pairwise ~ X1*X2, adjust="holm")
