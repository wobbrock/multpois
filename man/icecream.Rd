\title{Mixed factorial 2Ã—2 design with polytomous response data}
\format{
A data frame with 160 observations on the following 4 variables:
\describe{
\item{PId}{a participant identifier with levels \code{"1"} ... \code{"40"}}
\item{Age}{a between-subjects factor with levels \code{"adult"}, \code{"child"}}
\item{Season}{a within-subjects factor with levels \code{"fall"}, \code{"winter"}, \code{"spring"}, \code{"summer"}}
\item{Pref}{a polytomous response with categories \code{"vanilla"}, \code{"chocolate"}, \code{"strawberry"}}
}
}
\description{
This synthetic long-format data set represents a survey of 40 respondents about their
favorite ice cream flavors. Twenty of the respondents were adults and 20 were children.
They were asked four times over the course of a year, once in the middle of each season
(fall, winter, spring, summer), for their favorite ice cream flavor in that season.

This data set has a polytomous response \code{Pref} and two factors,
\code{Age} and \code{Season}. The response \code{Pref} has the unordered categories
\code{\{vanilla, chocolate, strawberry\}}. Factor \code{Age} has levels
\code{\{adult, child\}}. Factor \code{Season} has levels \code{\{fall, winter, spring, summer\}}.
It also has a \code{PId} column for a participant identifier. Each participant identifier is repeated
four times, once for each season.
