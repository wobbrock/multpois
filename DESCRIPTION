Description: Dichotomous responses having two categories can be analyzed
    with stats::glm() or lme4::glmer() using the family=binomial option.
    Unfortunately, polytomous responses with three or more unordered
    categories cannot be analyzed similarly because there is no analogous
    family=multinomial option. For between-subjects data,
    nnet::multinom() can address this need, but it cannot handle random
    factors and therefore cannot handle repeated measures. To address this
    gap, we transform nominal response data into counts for each categorical 
    alternative. These counts are then analyzed using (mixed) Poisson regression
    as per Baker (1994) <doi:10.2307/2348134>. Omnibus analyses of variance can be 
    run along with post hoc pairwise comparisons. For users wishing to analyze nominal 
    responses from surveys or experiments, the functions in this package essentially 
    act as though stats::glm() or lme4::glmer() had a family=multinomial option.
